## Goals

Primary goal is to learn CSS and Sass. Experimental framework.

- Responsive
- Flexbox
- Cross-browser support
- Use semantic HTML elements
- BEM naming convention

## Focus

- Use Flexboxes in a reliable way as much as possible
- Review all display and position options
- Understand floats
- Review inherit all..
- Review margin auto
- Transform & animations

## To-dos

General issues:
- Add table row border (similar to Skeleton)

- CSS lint

### Testing

- Protractor to run test
- Sauce Labs for cross-browser suite
- Applitools to do diffing
- Looked at Instadiff (not sure how to do cross-browser testing)

## Install

Install `node-sass` as an npm dep globally:
```
npm install -g node-sass
```
To compile: run `npm start`
